    		<h2> Introduction </h2>
    		<p> 
          The purpose of this assessment was to provide an overview of any security and privacy issues associated with a web application and a web server written by <a href="https://github.com/aditiashok"> Aditi Ashok </a>. This document also details possible solutions to the issues identified. The web application that is being assessed is a "Maurader's Map", which
          <ul> 
            <li> 1. retrieves the user's current location and sends it to a database server </li>
            <li> 2. retrives and displays the locations of other people who have submitted their locations. </li>
          </ul>
          The web application sends data to a web server that was developed using Heroku, Node.js, and the Express web Framework. The web server interacts with a MongoDB database to maintain and serve login information.
        </p>
        <p><span class="stress">
          An important note about the scope of the assessment: </span> the client was required to comply with strict specifiications when she built both the web application and the web server. In particular, she was neither required nor instructed to implement authentication. This assessment focuses on the ways that the API can be abused as well as the insecurities in the given code.

    		<h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p> The first part of this assesment relied on "black-box" testing in oreder to simulate a hacker's environment. This testing was done using curl and a modern web browser. After most of the obvious security flaws had been identified, the code was reviewed for further inspection. </p>

    <div class="row">
    	<div class="col-sm-12" id="abstract">
    		<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
    		<p>Provide an overview of all the security and privacy issues you identified. This section should be written for non-technical managers who do not have technical expertise and do not have time to read the entire document. Write this section using lay language.</p>

    		<h2>Issues</h2>
    		
    		<div class="col-sm-12">
          <h4>1. Database Injection using Cross-Site Scripting</h4>

          <div class="col-sm-12">
        		<p>Path to attack: POST /sendLocation API</p>
  			    <p>Severity of issue: <span class="high">HIGH</span>. A malicious user could put almost anything in the database using the /sendLocation API because the data in the login field is not validated in any way. </p>
  			    <p>By using curl, one is able to inject data into the database as long as the following three fields are provided: "login", "lat", and "lng". All three fields can contain Javascript. Database injection was tested using the following commands:
            </p>

            <p><code>curl -d 'login=&ltscript&gtalert("H@ck3d");&lt/script&gt&lat=3&lng=6'</code></p>
            <p><code>curl -d 'login=&ltscript&gtwindow.location.replace("http://stackoverflow.com");&lt/script&gt&lat=3&lng=6'</code></p>

            <p>The first command brought up an alert window, as shown below, and the second command successfully redirected the page.</p>

            <p><img src="before_hack.png" alt="before hack" title="Before script injection"/>
            <img src="XSS_alert.png" alt="after hack" title="After script injection"/></p>

  		      <p><span class="stress"> Resolution: </span> to fix this issue, the server needs to validate the user input before putting it in the database. The data from the "lat" and "lng" fields should be converted into floating point numbers and then checked to ensure that the values are numbers.</p>

            <p><pre><code> 
        var lat = parseFloat(request.body.lat);
        var lng = parseFloat(request.body.lng);
        if( lat == undefined || lng == undefined || isNaN(lat) || isNaN(lng) ) {
          response.send( {"error":"Whoops, something is wrong with your data!"} )
        }
            </code></pre></p>

            <p> There are a few ways to ensure that a user cannot manipulate the "login" field. 
              <ul>
                <li>1. Limit the number of characters that can be put into the "login" field, and reject the data if the user attempts to send more than specified. </li>
                <li>2. Convert all special characters to their HTML-code equvalents. </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

          </div>

      <div class="col-sm-12">
          <h4>2. Displaying User Information Without Authentication </h4>

          <div class="col-sm-12">
            <p>Path to attack: GET / or POST /sendLocation </p>
            <p>Severity of issue: <span class="high">HIGH</span>. Any user is able to access all the login data in the database. This is an enormous privacy issue because users may be unware of the fact and use their real names to login rather than an alias. </p>
            <p>This issue was discovered by accessing the index page of the web server. All the information in the database is also returned when a POST request is sent to /sendLocation, given that a "login", "lat", and "lng" are provided.</p>

            <p><img src="index_privacy.png" alt="privacy issue with index" title="All user information displayed on index page"/>
            <img src="post_privacy.png" alt="privacy issue with /sendLocation" title="User info displayed after POST /sendLocation"/></p>


            <p><span class="stress"> Resolution: </span> a server needs to require authentication to view the index page, as well as to send information via POST to the /sendLocation API. The client may wish to implement up a separate authentication server that monitors communication between the client and the server that interacts with the database. Several tutorials regarding security when using MongoDB can be found <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/administration/security/">here</a>.</p>
