### README file for Comp20: Web Programming
### Kalina Allen, 04/24/15

What is this purpose of this Git repository? 
	+ To store most of the work that I completed in Web Programming from January to April of 2015.

What was you favorite lab or assignment and why?
	+ Building an online portfolio was my favorite assignment because it prompted me to further explore the front-end side of Web Development. While completing the assignment, I gained valuable skills that enabled me to learn much more about the topic indepedently. Since then, I have built two other websites. 

How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
	+ I have grown immensely as a Computer Scientist, a Web Programmer, and a student. This course has encouraged me to take control of my own learning and to reach out to fellow students for help. It has also exposed me to many fundemental Computer Science priciples, as well as their relavence in the world of Web Development. 

What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? 
	+ The concept of sending a request and getting a response. More specifically, the way in which the request-reponse model is used to explain the interaction between several clients and servers. Even more specifically, I am particularly intriged by the difference between sychronous and asyncronous request-response models because these differences have a deep impact on the way code must be written. For example, while writing a server in assignment 3, I thought that there was no need for an 'else' statement if the previous 'if' statement ended with a response.send() command. This seemed natural given my C++ background. I quickly discovered the importance of the 'asychronous' in AJAX.  

Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into? 
	+ I'm interested in a lot of other topics! The following are explanations of a couple in particular. 
	+ My decision to study Computer Science was actually prompted by an interest in security. This course has given me an appreciation for the importance of security on the web, so I am planning on taking Comp116 sometime next year.
	+ I would also like to learn more about UX design. This summer, I have a great opportunity to do so through an internship with Big Tree Marketing (http://bigtreeonline.com).
